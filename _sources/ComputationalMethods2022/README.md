Here we explore growing a simple ODE simulator odesim.py and ODE modules.

About the exercise:

Please add your new dynamics module "xxx.py"

Make a copy of an existing module, such as first.py or second.py as you template, rename it, and implement an ODE of your interest. Just changing initial states or parameters is too trivial and not accepted.

After checking it locally, commit it to this repository and make a pull request. Do not overwrite an existing module, so that as more people contribute, you can see more ODEs to try with.

Enjoy collaboratory coding!
