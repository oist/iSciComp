# ## Aim of this Book
# 
# This book aims to provide students from non-computational backgrounds with the basic knowledge and practical skills of computing that are required in almost all fields of science today.
# 
# It also tries help students' intuitive understanding of basic mathamatical concepts like eigenvalues and stability through computation and visualization.
# 
# Python is used as the standard programming language, but the concepts covered can be helpful also in using other computing tools for data analysis and simulation.
# 
# ### Jupyter Book
# 
# This book is made by `Jupyter Book` from Jupyter Notebooks. An important feature is that you can download the source codes as Jupyter Notebook using the download icon on the top right of each page.
# 
# Rather than just reading the html or pdf text, please run the codes, change parameters, apply your own data, and modify the codes to see how the algorithms really work.

# ## Why Computation?
# * Theoretical analysis often requires simplifying assumptions.  
# * Thought experiment is limited/biased by the experimenter's thinking.
# * Huge data set is impossible to comprehend withtout numerical processing.
# * ...
